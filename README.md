# Timestamp-with-String
allows you to past a string with a Timestamp

I work in a lab and have to call critical values. Some of the programs such as SUNQuest Labortories don't have built in time stamps.

This program will save a string with a timestamp and variables to the clipboard to paste into any field you want.

It can be compiled into an exe using pyinstaller or a similar program so it will run on any computer.
